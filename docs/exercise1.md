    >Note: There may be a delay after pressing the **SQL database (preview) tile** and when the **New SQL database modal** appears. Just give it a few seconds if it does not appear immediately.

1. In the **New SQL database** dialog window, enter the name as **SqlDatabase<inject key="DeploymentID"> enableCopy="false"/>**, then click the **Create** button to proceed with database creation.

## Task 3: Loading the SQL database with sample data

1. To add sample data to the database, click the **Sample data** tile available on the SQL database home page. This allows you to quickly populate the database with predefined tables and data for testing and exploration.

2. Allow this to run for about **30â€“60 seconds** until you see a notification stating **Successfully imported sample data**.
